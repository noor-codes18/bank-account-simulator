# bank-account-simulator
My Second Python Project simulating a basic Bank Account System in the terminal. You can deposit money, withdraw funds, and check your balance using simple Python functions, loops, and conditional logic. 
This project was created right after learning how to define and use functions in Python.

🛠️ Built With
Python 3
Functions with parameters and return values
While loops
If-else statements
Formatted strings (f-strings)
Basic input handling

💡 Features
Menu-based interface
Deposit money to your account
Withdraw money with balance checking
View current balance at any time
Graceful exit with a goodbye message

📚 What I Learned
Creating and calling functions
Returning values from functions
Using loops and conditionals together
Managing a simple data structure (dictionary) to track balance
Formatting output using :.2f for clean money display
